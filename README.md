TODO:
    - Finish all the functions
        - Translate
            - New Microsoft App ID fixes this.
        - Dictionary
        - Variable
            - Global variables
            - List a user's variables.
            - Better `Remove' syntax.
            - Better syntax in general.
                - `.$ Reminder var contents here`
                - `.$ var contents here`
                - Get out, `=' character!
        - Calc
            - Needs to be rewritten.
        - Help
            - Make it print whether the function/operator is black/whitelisted
              or not.
        - AniDB
        - Lambdas ?
            - .\ x y => .an:x y
            - Can be stored in .$ variables
            - Can be used with planned parens
        - Diff
            - f x y = filter (not . (`elem` y)) x
        - Lewd
            - Add an argument, how many lewds to print.
              No more `.lewd ++ .lewd ++ .lewd ++ .lewd`!
    - Add command line arguments, such as making it not autojoin any
      servers/channels and instead only join ones specified by a certain
      parameter.
    - Core data needs to be parsed, such as `getservers'.
    - Add `owner' to Server data.
        - Be able to control KawaiiBot through ownership
            - Quit servers/channels
            - Join Servers/channels
            - Other stuff
    - Add operator escaping or make certain functions ignore operators.
    - Add parens for the functions/operators
        - `.lewd -> (.ra 100 -> .sed s/matcher/replacer/)`
    - Add timeouts between usage of functions that can be customized per channel
      in Config.hs.
        - Per channel and user or just channel timeout?
    - Let `events' store data for later use.
        - Make event functions loop in their own threads and pass data to each
          other. This will allow functions such as `diff' to work properly.
            - Even functions that output the same to all channels.
            - Odd functions that run the event function for each channel.
    - Add more lewdness
        - pls giv ideas
    - Remove unnecessary modules.
    - Customizable function prefix.
    - Add data storing for functions somewhere.
        - Use MVar ?
- Switch from `Network.Curl' to `Network.HTTP'.
- Find a new weather API.
- Use Parsec or Attoparsec to parse the history.
